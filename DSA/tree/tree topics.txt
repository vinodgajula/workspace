### **Week 1: Fundamentals of Trees**
**Topics to Learn:**
1. Introduction to Trees:
   - Definition, terminologies (root, parent, child, leaf, etc.).
   - Properties and applications of trees.
2. Types of Trees:
   - General Tree.
   - Binary Tree and its variants (Full, Complete, Perfect, Skewed).

**Tasks:**
- Implement a basic tree structure.
- Write code to display a tree hierarchy.

**Practice:**
- Visualize tree structures (small examples).
- Draw tree diagrams for various examples.

### **Week 2: Tree Traversals**
**Topics to Learn:**
1. Tree Traversal Techniques:
   - Depth-First Search (DFS): Preorder, Inorder, Postorder.
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS): Level Order Traversal.

**Tasks:**
- Implement traversal methods for binary trees.
- Compare recursion vs. iterative traversal techniques.

**Practice:**
- Solve problems that require tree traversals:
  - Print nodes at a given level.
  - Print all leaf nodes.

### **Week 3: Binary Search Tree (BST)**
**Topics to Learn:**
1. Binary Search Tree:
   - Properties and characteristics.
   - Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Search.

**Tasks:**
- Implement a Binary Search Tree from scratch.
- Write functions for insertion, deletion, and search.

**Practice:**
- Solve problems:
  - Find the minimum and maximum elements in a BST.
  - Check if a given tree is a BST.

---

### **Week 4: Balanced Trees**
**Topics to Learn:**
1. AVL Tree:
   - Rotations (Left, Right, Left-Right, Right-Left).
   - Insertion and Deletion in AVL Trees.
2. Red-Black Tree (basic understanding).

**Tasks:**
- Implement an AVL Tree and handle rotations.
- Explore Red-Black Tree logic (focus on understanding).

**Practice:**
- Problems on AVL Trees:
  - Insert and balance nodes in an AVL Tree.

---

### **Week 5: Advanced Tree Variants**
**Topics to Learn:**
1. Heaps:
   - Min-Heap, Max-Heap.
   - Heapify, Insert, Delete.
2. Tries:
   - Prefix Tree for string operations.

**Tasks:**
- Implement a Min-Heap and Max-Heap.
- Build a Trie for word search.

**Practice:**
- Problems:
  - Find Kth smallest/largest element using heaps.
  - Search and autocomplete in a Trie.

---

### **Week 6: Tree Algorithms**
**Topics to Learn:**
1. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA).
2. Tree Diameter.
3. Height-Balanced Tree Check.

**Tasks:**
- Implement algorithms for:
  - Finding the LCA of two nodes.
  - Computing the height of a tree.
  - Checking if a tree is height-balanced.

**Practice:**
- Solve problems:
  - Find the diameter of a binary tree.
  - Check if a binary tree is balanced.

---

### **Week 7: Advanced Topics**
**Topics to Learn:**
1. Tree Construction Problems:
   - Construct tree from inorder and preorder.
   - Construct tree from inorder and postorder.
2. Segment Tree and Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree).

**Tasks:**
- Implement a segment tree for range queries.
- Implement a Fenwick Tree for prefix sums.

**Practice:**
- Solve problems on:
  - Tree construction from traversals.
  - Range queries using segment trees.

---

### **Week 8: Special Topics**
**Topics to Learn:**
1. Binary Tree Views:
   - Top View, Bottom View, Left View, Right View.
2. Tree Serialization and Deserialization.
3. Morris Traversal.

**Tasks:**
- Implement code for each type of binary tree view.
- Practice serialization and deserialization logic.

**Practice:**
- Solve problems on:
  - Printing binary tree views.
  - Traversals without recursion.

---

### Daily Commitment:
- **Study Time:** 1-2 hours/day.
- **Practice:** Solve at least 3-5 problems after learning a concept.
- Use platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org), or [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com).
